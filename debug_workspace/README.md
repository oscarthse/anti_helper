# Project Name

## Overview
This project is a REST API designed to handle various operations related to [describe the domain or purpose of the API]. It is built using Python and follows best practices for API development, including structured code organization, comprehensive error handling, and robust testing.

## Features
- Feature 1: Describe the first key feature of the API.
- Feature 2: Describe the second key feature.
- Feature 3: Describe any additional features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   cd yourproject
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the API
To start the API server, run the following command:
```bash
python run.py
```
The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

### API Endpoints
- `GET /endpoint1`: Description of what this endpoint does.
- `POST /endpoint2`: Description of what this endpoint does.

### Example Request
Here's an example of how to make a request to the API using `curl`:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/endpoint1
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
To run the test suite, use the following command:
```bash
pytest
```
Ensure that your virtual environment is activated and all dependencies are installed before running the tests.

### Writing Tests
Tests are located in the `tests` directory and are written using the `pytest` framework. Ensure that any new features are accompanied by appropriate tests.
